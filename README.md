2. cd HMD-React-Movie-App
3. npm install

Additionally, you need rename .env_sample to .env and add your own API key inside .env

### Thoughts

My second React.js application. I really enjoyed designing the application and the thought process on how to split it into components
Saw the advantages of using redux for state management and the axios instance
For the future:

- split reducers
- better overall organization of the code
- more emphasis of DRY principle
