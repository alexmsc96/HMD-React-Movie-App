## Description

This application consists of a movie app where the users are able to:

- Fetch movies from a third-party API
- See the latest, upcoming and popular movies in real-time
- See movie details
- Add a movie to collection, which is also saved in LocalStorage
- Search for movies

## Demo

**[Check it out](https://hmd-react.herokuapp.com/)**

## To run locally

1. git clone https://github.com/alexmsc96/HMD-React-Movie-App.git
2. cd HMD-React-Movie-App
3. npm install
4. npm run

Additionally, you need rename .env_sample to .env and add your own API key inside .env

### Thoughts

For my second React.js application, I really enjoyed designing the application and the thought process on how to split it into React components
Saw the advantages of using redux for state management and the axios instance for faster coding.

### Goals 
For the future:

- split reducers
- better overall organization of the code
- more emphasis of DRY principle
